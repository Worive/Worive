# Hi there I'm Worive ðŸ‘‹
I mainly code in Java, but i could do a bit of Python and PHP.

I'm still learning Java thru JetBrain's Academy ðŸ‘€

## Minecraft Development
I've been doing plugins for 2 years for modded networks and patching bugs with Sponge Mixins.

### Known APIs
- Spigot API (It's what i'm confident with)
- Sponge API (only tried out 1.12.2)
- Sponge Mixins
